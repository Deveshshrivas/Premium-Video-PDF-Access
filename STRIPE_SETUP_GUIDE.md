## Troubleshooting

### "No checkout URL received"
```bash
# Check server logs
# Verify STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_PRICE_ID are set
# Check if Stripe package is installed: npm list stripe
```

### "Webhook signature verification failed"
```bash
# Verify STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches Stripe Dashboard
# Check webhook endpoint URL is correct
# Ensure server is running on port 3002
```

### "Payment succeeded but not upgraded"
```bash
# Check webhook events in Stripe Dashboard
# Look for errors in server console
# Verify MongoDB connection is working
# Check user subscription status in database
```

### "Upgrade button not showing premium access"
```bash
# Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
# Check user object has subscription.status = 'active'
# Verify /api/auth/verify returns subscription data
# Check browser console for errors
```
